    "tips": "In parkour games like Vex X3M 2, it's usually a bad idea to speed through a level on your first try.

If the game gives you special movement tools like gliders or teleporters like this one, spend some time getting used to how they work. They can really help, but they're not always easy to control at first.\n\nPay attention to the rhythm of moving traps just like you did in Geometry Dash. Most of them follow predictable patterns because the obstacles and timing are usually fine-tuned by game designers. So once you get the timing down, dodging becomes much easier. And if you crash? Don't sweat it. Quickly restart from your last checkpoint and try again. The faster you finish, the better your score or star rating will be.\n\nAlso, don't ignore unlockable items like skins. They might seem cosmetic, but in a lot of these games, unlocking new gear is a sign that you've really mastered the course. It's a fun way to show off your progress.",

With new mechanics like kite gliding and teleportation portals, each level becomes a wild ride filled with action.You'll race through obstacle-packed tracks, soar across massive gaps, and flip your way through moving traps. Be warned! This game requires lots of gaming skills. But it's also rewarding if you dare to speed. So don't be afraid to take risks! Just be ready for the unexpected because platforms fall, walls move, and one wrong move could send you back to the last checkpoint flag.ControlsAccelerate: W or Up ArrowTilt Left/Right:  A / D or Left and right arrow keysBrake/Reverse: S or Down ArrowHow to Play Vex X3M 2Start by choosing a level track from the map.
