It starts with relatively easy missions and the difficulty ramps up slowly. You can prove you can handle tight turns and avoid reckless drivers while collecting enough cash to unlock more upgrades. In Race mode, challenge tough AI opponents in an intense head-to-head showdown, collect nitrous on the road to gain an edge over your rival. Want something different? Special Event mode offers fun tasks and big loot rewards.",
