  "fullContent": "Homeâ€º ClickerNova ClickerBy OnlineGames.ioMake Game Full ScreenNova Clicker is an online idle game which starts you off with a single, smiley Nova, its name is FreezeNova. A simple tap or click on FreezeNova produces your first handful of stars. But don't be fooled, this clicker game quickly grows beyond basic tapping. Soon, you'll be managing an entire universe of quirky characters and powerful upgrades, all designed to make you the ultimate star tycoon.ControlsOn a Computer: Click on FreezeNova to earn stars.On a Mobile Device: Tap the character to begin generating stars.Start Your Star JourneyBegin by clicking (or tapping) FreezeNova, your first Nova character. Each click earns you stars, the main currency of Nova Clicker. It starts off simple, but trust me, the clicking is just the beginning of your cosmic empire. Keep tapping regularly to build your star supply quickly, especially at the start.Explore the Nova ShopTo the right of your screen, you'll notice the Nova Shop. This shop is your gateway to a variety of powerful tools and upgrades. As you gather more stars, invest them wisely here. Some essential early upgrades include: nova atom booster, bomb and asteroid. Later, you can even unlock an earth destroyer. Regularly check the shop on the right side as new, more powerful items unlock when you achieve star milestones.Unlock New NovasAs your star empire grows, you'll unlock brand-new Novas, each with its own unique personality and star-generating power. Characters such as Police Nova, King Nova, Baby Nova, and even the funky Immortal Nova are waiting to be discovered. Every Nova you unlock boosts your clicking power and star generation significantly, helping you speed up your progress and make star-collecting even more exciting. If you like one of them and don't want to change it, no worries. Just click the t-shirt icon on the top and choose your character.Catch Golden NovasOccasionally, Golden Novas drift quickly across your screen, and they're your golden ticket to massive star bonuses. These Novas appear randomly, so keep your eyes open and your fingers ready. Clicking a Golden Nova provides a big influx of stars, sometimes enough to instantly purchase a much-needed upgrade. Missing one isn't the end of the world; just watch for the next one!Activate the x2 Speed BoostFeeling impatient or looking for rapid progress? Nova Clicker provides an amazing speed-up feature called the x2 Speed Boost. Activating this boost doubles your clicking speed and passive star generation for 60 seconds. You only need to watch a brief ad to activate it. To maximize efficiency, consider using this booster strategically: you can use it when you're close to unlocking a new Nova character or powerful upgrade. Or perhaps you can combine it with your strongest passive upgrades to collect stars even quicker.Travel to New Cosmic BackgroundsAs you progress through Nova Clicker, your space journey will take you beyond your initial location. You'll travel through new cosmic settings such as the moon, mars, star rain, outer space and galaxy. Access them by clicking on the cloud icon on the top of your screen.Prestige for Even Bigger RewardsOnce you've collected tons of stars, unlocked most of the available upgrades, and explored various backgrounds, it's time for the prestige upgrade, also called ascension. Ascending resets all your income and Nova universe but grants you permanent bonuses and a multiplier effect on your next run. Use Ascension when your progress slows down or when you're ready to achieve higher goals faster. It's like starting a new game, but with incredible power-ups already in your pocket. Here's how it works:You'll restart with your initial Nova but keep valuable bonuses.Each ascension provides a cumulative multiplier, meaning you'll generate stars much faster with every reset. Track the multiplier on the ascension button.Strategic ascensions allow you to unlock powerful upgrades even quicker each time.DeveloperFreezeNova Game Studio is the mastermind behind Nova Clicker.
