  "fullContent": "Home› ArcadeGeometry EscapeBy OnlineGames.ioMake Game Full ScreenGeometry Escape is an excellent choice for gamers looking for a skill game challenge, especially if you enjoy fast-paced platformers similar to Geometry Dash. It's an online platformer game where you guide a cube on an obstacle course. The cube moves automatically at a certain speed, and you'll control the jumps and flights to avoid obstacles on your path. In this, you will need right-in-time jumps and quick reflexes. The absence of checkpoints makes every level a test of skill and patience, pushing you to learn from each attempt rather than just progressing through trial and error.ControlsComputers: Press or hold the spacebar or left-click to jump and fly.Mobile: Tap and hold the screen to jump and fly.How to Play Geometry EscapeYour cube moves forward automatically.
