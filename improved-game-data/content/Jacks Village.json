They will give you a lot of trouble. These missions are a bit challenging. But I think you have the potential to handle them all. You only have one dagger in this mode. You can only perform melee combat. Swing your shots well!Explore Endless ModeThis mode is for you to roam freely. Here, you can wander around the village and come into contact with civilians.
