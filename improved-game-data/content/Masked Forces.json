    "howToPlay": "The gameplay is intense as players are deployed into a map to battle, and the player with the highest number of kills wins the match. You never know when your opponents may come, so keep moving, aim cautiously, and be vigilant. While playing, you get to check your kill feed, HP, ammo and radar on your screen.\n\nA special feature in the gameplay is the ability to pick up enemies’ weapons after knockdown.\n\nIn this mode, you are offered a variety of missions with different objectives. In level 1, you have 3 active tasks to choose from.\n\nMission 1 is to win a death match; in this mission, 6 players are deployed to battle, and the first player with 15 kills wins the game.\n\nMission 2 is to eliminate 3 enemies; in this mission, your objective is to eliminate 3 enemies to pass the mission. However, if your player kills 2 enemies and gets knocked down, you must restart the mission. So ensure you get that 3-kill streak to complete the task.\n\nMission 3 is to survive for 50 seconds; in this mission, you have to survive for 50 seconds, and the player’s movement and speed are reduced. To survive, either you take down your enemies, or you find cover for 50 seconds.\n\nRewards for completion are $250 and 1000 XP each.\n\nIn level 2, the active missions are pretty the same, only that some active tasks are still level 1 difficulty with the same cash and XP reward. But level 2 difficulty has a cash price of $300 and 1100 XP.\n\nMasked Forces Level 2 active missions are:\n\nWin a death match (level 1 difficulty)Eliminate 3 enemies (level 1 difficulty)Win a death match (level 2 difficulty)\n\nMasked Forces Level 3 active missions are:\n\nWin a death match (level 3 difficulty)Eliminate 3 enemies (level 1 difficulty)Survive for 50 seconds (level 1 difficulty)\n\nThere are several fascinating missions and objectives to enjoy in this game, providing you with a realistic sense of being on the battlefield.",
