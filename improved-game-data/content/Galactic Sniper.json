Right-click to aim and release it to shoot. Take down spy robots in the first few levels until you adjust to the game. After the third level, you'll come across moving robots, which are more difficult to target. Tackling Moving MechsMechs are moving around, tracking your base and taking pictures of it. Some of them are very fast, so you should focus while targeting them. Observe their patterns and anticipate their paths. Lead your shots to intercept their paths. Try shooting a little ahead of their trajectory. In this way, until the bullet arrives, mechs will be in the spot you aimed. You can practice how far from the mechs to aim a few times to find the ideal length. Use Your Ammo SmartYou have limited ammo; use your bullets efficiently and don't take any careless shots. Assess your targets and available ammo at the outset of each level, devising a strategy for maximum efficiency. You can check the number of bullets at the top of your screen. DeveloperFreezeNova created this game.Explore FurtherIf you like mobile friendly sniper games like Galactic Sniper and enjoy gameplay without any complex controls, your next stop is Sniper Elite.
