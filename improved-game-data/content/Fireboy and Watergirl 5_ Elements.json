Tools and obstacles are the same with the other FBWG games: Lava, lake, goo, boxes, and switches. This temple contains 10 levels.Fire Temple: In this temple, Fireboy is completely free to move around. It's all lava. So he will assist Watergirs by carrying boxes and toggling switches to help her overcome lots of obstacles on her way. Fire Temple has 8 levels.Water Temple: Tables are turned in the Water Temple. This time, WAtergirl can go everywhere in the level as there are many lakes. She'll help and guide Fireboy to the end gate. Water Temple contains 9 levels.Light Temple: Lights activate things in the level. Characters will use mirrors to redirect light and open gates or activate switches in levels. Light Temple has 9 levels in total.Ice Temple: The ice obstacle comes in the temple. Fireboy can slide quickly on ice but can't climb snowy slopes; meanwhile, Watergirl can walk through water and climb snow but is slowed by ice. This temple introduces melting and freezing lights players can utilize. There are 9 levels in total.Wind Temple: In this, characters will use wind blowers to reach higher spots. But the wind also block their path sometimes. This mechanic creates both an advantage and blockage in the levels, which players should master by using it. Wind Temple has 8 levels.Crystal Temple: In Cyristal Temple, both characters can use portals to teleport to different spots on the level. However, some of the portals need to be activated with switches. 9 levels are available in this temple.Editor's NoteFireboy and Watergril brings back my childhood memories of when me and my sister used to huddle together in front of our old, chunky desktop. Back then, we would spend hours—sometimes giggling and other times bickering—as we tackled every level we could find online.On a deeper level, Fireboy and Watergirl is a game that beautifully illustrates the power of cooperation. We know that each of us has our own strengths and weaknesses, but when we combine a weakness with someone else's strength, we create a powerful synergy. It's a reminder that no mission is impossible when we work together.To this day, Fireboy and Watergirl has captured the hearts of many and been the reason for falling in love with gaming. We're both proud and excited to introduce you to the fifth installment of the series, available for free on OnlineGames.io. We hope you enjoy playing the game as much as I and my sister enjoyed it years ago!DeveloperFireboy and Watergirl 5: Elements was developed by Oslo Albet.
