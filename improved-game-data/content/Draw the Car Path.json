Cars move more naturally with curved paths. Sharp turns can lead to unexpected collisions.Consider how cars will interact with each other once they start moving. Will one block another’s path? Adjust accordingly.Draw longer paths for some cars. If multiple cars are moving, staggering their start times by making some travel longer distances can prevent crashes. Try using S-shaped paths, loops, or extra turns to delay their arrival, ensuring they don’t block or crash into others.Don't always take the shortest path; sometimes, a longer but safer route is the best option.If you notice a potential mistake before pressing play, erase and redraw instead of relying on luck.Avoid making paths that barely squeeze past obstacles. A slight misalignment can lead to a crash.If cars need to park in a sequence, make sure the first one reaches its spot before the second blocks the way.Use walls and star locations to guide cars into correct positions, but make sure they don’t become obstacles themselves.\n\nEmbed URL:",
