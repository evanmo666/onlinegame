Akagi is the most difficult track in Drift Hunters according to many drifters.Fog MountainAkagiOther SettingsTo have a captivating gaming experience, having the ideal settings is essential. Before hitting the curvy roads, make your decisions on gearbox, graphics and volume.Gearbox: You can switch between manual and automatic gearbox. While professional drifters always choose the manual, it's completely okay to prefer casually hanging out with an automatic gearbox.Volume: Drift Hunters 2 has great sound effects where you can enjoy the squeezing sounds of drifting, engine throttle, crashes and many more. You can max the volume and enjoy the sounds fully. Or lower the volume so that you can also hear the music playing on your PC. Graphics: This one is highly critical for a smooth experience. You can choose between 3 levels of graphics: Low, medium and high. We recommend adjusting this setting according to your CPU, graphic card",
