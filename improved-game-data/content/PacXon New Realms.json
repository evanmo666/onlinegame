It's part strategy, part action, and all satisfying (especially when you trap those pesky enemies in a corner and watch the progress bar tick up to 80%.) In case you're new to world of PacXon, here‚Äôs a quick Arcade 101 refresher:What is PacXon?PacXon (sometimes written as Pac-Xon) is a fun arcade-style puzzle game that mixes mechanics from classic games like Pac-Man and Xonix. In this fun game, you play as Pacxon, a little PacMan-like character, but instead of eating dots, your goal is to fill up the screen by building walls. As you move, Pacxon leaves a trail behind him. If you can successfully close off a section of the screen, that area becomes filled in. The goal is to fill at least 80% of the screen to complete the level. PacXon was originally a Flash game released in 2007, but 18 years later, an HTML5 version was published so it can be played online without plugins.ControlsArrow keys/ drag mouse: Move PacXon in four directionsMouse swipe: For touchscreen and drag-based inputHow to Play PacXon: New RealmsYour goal is to capture at least 80% of the field to move on.
