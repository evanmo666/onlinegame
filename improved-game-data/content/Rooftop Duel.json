Tap jump, hold to aim, then let go to shoot. Every shot packs recoil, so a blast can rescue you from the edge or fling you into mid-air.Floaty jumps give you a moment to dodge an incoming bullet, or if you mistime things, you'll sail straight into the abyss. If you stay up while your opponent falls, you win the round, collect coins, and head back to the shop for an even sillier weapon before the next rooftop showdown.Game ModesRooftop Duel has three main game modes that offer different ways to play depending on whether you're playing alone or with a friend.2 Player Mode: local multiplayer mode where two players share the same keyboard. Each player uses their own set of keys to jump and shoot. First player uses W and E while the second uses I and O keys. The round continues until one player knocks the other off the rooftop. You'll play 5 rounds to complete a match. This mode is only available on devices with a keyboard, so it is best played on a laptop or desktop. If you're using a mobile, try other modes instead.Missions Mode: a series of short levels, each with a specific objective. It's a good place to start if you want to get used to the controls, learn how different weapons behave, and see new rooftops each round.Survivor Mode: the goal is to stay alive for as long as possible. You'll face a continuous wave of enemies. The difficulty increases the longer you last. This mode requires a bit quicker reactions and good control compared to other modes. It's recommended to unlock more powerful weapons before playing, as basic gear can make it difficult to survive for long.DeveloperRooftop Duel is cooked up by FreezeNova, the studio behind a stack of popular unblocked ragdoll games like Soccer Random Pro.More Gun Games OnlineIf you're hooked on floppy firefights, try Total Recoil next.
