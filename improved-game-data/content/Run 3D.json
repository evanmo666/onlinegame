Their journey takes them through a series of mysterious space tunnels floating between the stars and planets. These tunnels hold unknown dangers, such as unstable tiles, unexpected gaps, and gravity-bending walls. The alien must keep running, jumping, and adapting to survive and reach their ultimate goal: the Sun. Every step brings them closer to the goal. But one wrong move and you send the alien into the void. Do you have what it takes to guide them through this endless cosmic game? If yes, start playing Run 3D now!ControlsArrow Keys / WASD: Move left, right, and jumpSpacebar: JumpHow to Play Run 3D?Start running automatically through the space tunnel.Use the controls to jump over gaps and avoid falling into space.Rotate the tunnel by moving into walls, changing the direction of gravity.Watch out for unstable tiles that disappear when you step on them.Unlock new characters, each with a wacky alien look.Keep running and see how far you can go!Gravity RotationOne of the most interesting part of Run 3D is the gravity rotation. Unlike standard platformers, this game allows you to shift gravity by running into the tunnel walls. When you move left or right and reach a wall, the entire tunnel rotates, making that surface the new floor. This feature opens up endless ways to navigate obstacles, avoid gaps, and find the safest route forward.Secondly, the tunnel itself constantly changes shape. You won’t just be running through simple square corridors. Some tunnels have pentagons, hexagons, octagons, and even 10-sided polygons. As the number of sides increases, the tunnel feels wider and more unpredictable, making gravity rotation even more important. Some shapes offer easier paths, while others require precise movement to survive. Mastering gravity shifts and adapting to different tunnel shapes is key to lasting longer in Run 3D!More Running GamesIf you enjoy Run 3D, you might also like endless running and platforming games that test your reflexes.
