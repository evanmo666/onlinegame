    "howToPlay": "Running Papa's Sushiria might sound overwhelming at first, but once you get the hang of it, it's super satisfying. Everything starts when a customer walks in and places their order. You'll need to pay close attention to what they want—every little detail counts, from the type of rice to the fillings, sauces, and even their bubble tea preferences.\n\nOnce you've got the order down, it's time to cook the rice. This part is all about timing. You scoop the right amount, start the cooker, and wait for it to finish. Don't leave it too long or it'll burn. While it cooks, you can get things ready for the next steps.\n\nNext comes the fun part: building the sushi roll. Lay out the seaweed, spread the rice, stack the fillings in the right order, then roll it up just right. It might take a couple tries to get perfect, but it feels great when you nail it. After rolling, you'll slice the sushi evenly and add any toppings or sauces the customer asked for. Presentation really matters here.\n\nThen it's off to the drink station. Most customers want a bubble tea to go with their food, so you'll need to pick the correct tea, the flavor, and how much ice and boba to add. It's a mini-game on its own and a fun way to break things up.\n\nOnce everything's ready, hand the order over and see how you did. The customer will rate you based on accuracy, timing, and how neat everything looks. High scores mean bigger tips, which you can use for upgrades, new furniture, or snazzy uniforms. As you level up, more ingredients and customers unlock, making each day a little more exciting—and a little more hectic!",
