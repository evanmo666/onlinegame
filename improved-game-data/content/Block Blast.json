These blocks come in shapes reminiscent of Tetris: I, L, T, Z, S, and a few chunky surprises as you advance.Drag and drop these blocks onto the grid. After every three moves, a new trio of blocks awaits your command.Your mission is to create full vertical or horizontal lines without any gaps. Once a line is complete, it vanishes, clearing space for more blocks. Keep this dance going until the board is too cluttered for any more moves.Adventure ModeHere, the grid might not be so forgiving. Levels start with pre-placed blocks, setting the stage for your strategic maneuvers.Each level presents unique goals. Perhaps you need to clear a certain number of tiles, or maybe you're on a gem hunt. As levels escalate, so does the objectives' complexity, with more blocks already on the grid to navigate around.Every cleared line nets you 10 points, but the real fun begins with combos and streaks. Chain together line clears for bonus points, turning each move into a potential score multiplier.In both modes, the essence of Block Blast remains a puzzle game where your wits and planning determine how long you can keep the blocks dancing on the grid.DeveloperBlock Blast Unblocked game was created by FreezeNova.Explore Online Block GamesDive into a world where blocks aren't just for building but for battling, solving, and creating!
