You will see their jets coming towards you from afar.

You need to protect your jet from taking damage from their assaults as much as possible.Your primary task is to survive in this empty arena by shooting the enemy ships while avoiding their attacks.Invasion or Campaign in Space?There are two game mods in Alien Sky Invasion: Invasion and Campaign. You can find a brief explanation for each below.Invasion: In the Invasion mode, you have missions that must be fulfilled. The aliens will try to invade your territory in Space. You must eliminate them one by one. Your first task is destroying 30 enemy ships.Campaign: There are 100 levels in Campaign mode. Missions in the Campaign mode seem more straightforward than Invasion mode. But as you level up, the tasks here will become more complex. You will need more powerful jets to cope with these challenges.Jet AircraftsYou can find six jet aircraft, each more potent than the other. View their fighter status from the menu. Each aircraft has damage, armor, energy, and speed status at a certain level. You will be able to access new jets as you level up in Campaign mode. Hover over a jet, and you can see at which level it can be unlocked.Jetâ€™s WeaponsYour jet has two distinct weapons. You can destroy your enemiesâ€™ ships by shooting them with lasers or launching a missile. Missiles are more advantageous as when you locate the ships and launch a missile, the missile automatically locks on to the enemy and hits it even if the enemy ship moves. But to be able to launch a rocket, you have to aim precisely at the enemy ship.Level Bonuses in Alien Sky InvasionLevel 75: Your jet will have self-repairing armor.Level 100: All the jets you have will have max status.Level 125: Your jetâ€™s energy regeneration ability will rise to +50%.ControlsTo control the jet, use the WASD keys.To boost the speed, use the Space or the Shift key.To shoot, use the left mouse click.To launch a missile, use the right mouse click.To pause, use the Tab key.DeveloperAlien Sky Invasion is created by FreezeNova.Explore More Airplane GamesIf you are an Alien Sky Invasion fan, you should check Starblast.io.
