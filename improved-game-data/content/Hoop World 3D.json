  "fullContent": "Home› BasketballHoop World 3DBy OnlineGames.ioMake Game Full ScreenGet ready to flip, jump, and dunk your way through wild levels in Hoop World 3D! This 3D basketball game isn’t your average dunk contest, it’s a high-flying, time-your-jump-right kind of ride with trampolines, wormholes, and some seriously wacky physics. You'll bounce across floating platforms like a legendary NBA player, fly through space portals, and try to land the perfect slam dunk... all while doing as many flips as possible. The more flips you pull off, the more coins you earn, and the cooler you look when you finally dunk it.Every level brings a new challenge. Some jumps are short and sweet, others launch you through entire worlds. Mess up your timing, and you’ll go crashing into the ground (with some pretty funny falls, honestly). But stick the landing, and you’ll feel like a hero. In case you'd like to keep on dunking after playing Hoop World 3D, you can try Basketball io for free on OnlineGames.io!ControlsComputers:Hold left click or spacebar to flip in the airRelease to attempt a dunkMobile Devices:Tap and hold anywhere on the screen to flipRelease your finger to dunkHow to Play Hoop World 3DStart a level, hold left click to launch yourself into the air.Hold to keep flipping, every extra spin earns you more coins.If there's a wormholes, try to enter it during flight.

If you'd like to play another sports game by them, you can play Golf Orbit for free on OnlineGames.ioEditor’s ReviewAt first, I honestly thought Hoop World 3D was just one of those games where the flips happen on their own and you just kinda watch. I didn’t expect to have much control. But nope, I was totally wrong. The timing actually matters a lot, and if you mess it up, your player just faceplants in the funniest way possible. It took me a few tries to figure out the rhythm, but once I did, it got super fun and kind of addicting. I caught myself saying, “Okay, last level,” like five times in a row.The wormholes that launch you into different places mid-air are such a cool touch, and unlocking characters like Hulk or Spiderman makes it even better. It’s got that perfect mix of silly physics and satisfying challenge. And believe me, this one has over the top graphics compared to average stickman ragdoll games. So yes, this game’s a great way to kill time in the best way. Definitely one of those browser games you come back to. So… ready to flip, fly, and dunk like a pro?Technical InfoGame Provider: TapNationLanguages: EnglishRelease Date:  2024 (Web-GL), 2021 (iOS & Android) Genre: Sports, ArcadeMode: SingleplayerPlatforms: Web browser (desktop and mobile), Android, iOSControls: MouseSave: Saved in browser cacheThis article was updated on March 28, 20251 Player3DArcadeBallBasketballFreeFunPhysicsSports",
