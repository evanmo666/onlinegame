You face a giant cube made of arrow-marked bricks. Your goal is to slide each cube away without bumping into other blocks. Classic Mode offers unlimited moves and hundreds of handcrafted puzzles. In Adventure Mode, you travel through five historic worlds: Ancient Egypt, Medieval Europe, the Aztec Empire, Feudal Japan, and more, using only a set number of moves per level.ControlsClick and drag (or swipe) the screen spin blocks.Click (or tap) it to slide a blockClick on booster icons to activate power-upsHow to PlayAt the start of each level, you see a large cluster made of smaller arrow-marked blocks. Your first task is to scan all six faces of this cluster by rotating the view. Look for blocks that are not blocked by any others in the direction their arrows point. When you find one, click (or swipe) it, and the block will slide off the cluster along that path. In Classic Mode, you can slide blocks at your own pace and take as many moves as you like until the cube is empty. The challenge grows as blocks come in different sizes, so you must think a few steps ahead to avoid creating dead ends.Adventure ModeAdventure Mode adds a move limit to each of its 25 levels. You begin in Ancient Egypt with simple, small clusters and plenty of moves. As you unlock new worlds—through Medieval Europe, the Aztec Empire, and Feudal Japan—the puzzles grow larger and more complex. Here, every swipe matters. You'll need to plan a sequence of slides that clears the cube without running out of moves. Watch the counter in the corner and map out your path before making your first slide. Some levels hide a key block deep inside the cluster; you may need to clear the outer layers first to free up space. This mode tests both your planning and your patience.BoostersIf you get stuck, boosters can save the day. Unblock It 3D offers three handy power-ups you earn as you clear levels. The Arrow Switch lets you rotate any block's arrow, opening new paths. The Bomb removes a small cluster of blocks in one go, perfect when no slide will free a stubborn brick. The Hint highlights a single move you can make, guiding you out of tricky spots. Boosters refill slowly in Classic Mode but recharge faster in Adventure Mode when you finish a level under the move limit. Use them sparingly since your stock carries over between levels in Adventure Mode.DeveloperAzerion Casual Games built this 3D puzzle game to help players sharpen their minds without any complex rules.
