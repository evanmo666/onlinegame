    "howToPlay": "You begin the game with a basic monster truck: yellow with red flames. It's your starter vehicle, and it’s just enough to get you through the early levels. The main goal is to complete each track without crashing and getting the ranking bonus. If your truck lands upside down at any point, the race ends immediately, and you’ll restart from the beginning of that level. During the race, a nitro bar at the top of the screen shows how much boost you have left. Timing your nitro at the right moment can make the difference between flying over an obstacle and crashing into it.There are 24 levels to unlock, and you progress one at a time by finishing the current stage. Coins are scattered along the way and rewarded for successful races. These coins are crucial for your progress.You can spend coins in two key ways:Upgrade your truck’s engine power or nitro capacity, both for 100 coins each.Unlock new trucks, each with unique designs. From classic styles to shark and sports-car hybrids, they range in price from 150 to 800 coins.Before each race, you can enter the garage, view your truck, and upgrade performance to help clear tougher levels more easily.",
