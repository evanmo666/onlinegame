He also has the power to knock his opponents off their feet.Make him move by using the left and arrow keys. To dodge their attacks, press the down arrow key.We would also like to say that you can go for combinations in attack styles.For example, pressing the D key while running towards an electric fighter will throw him into the air.But make sure he doesn't fall on you when you throw him. Otherwise, he will hurt you by his weight.Moves in Slow-MotionYour stickman can perform slow-motion moves in combat in addition to regular attack moves. The Q, W and E keys allow you to act slowly. However, keep in mind that although such moves take more health, they consume battery points.It means that your character cannot take such actions all the time. He needs to wait until the battery is recharged. But it is worth waiting for the charging, thanks to the severe damage rate caused by slow actions.How many rounds are there in Electric Man 2?There are 19 rounds of combat in Electric Man 2.
