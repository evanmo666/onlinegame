There are three unique courses: Running, Flying and Swimming.In running training, the duckling will try to avoid the rolling objects by jumping over them.Flying training is to strengthen its durability at altitudes. Finally, it will be put through the hoop in the deep seas during swimming training.Increase the EnergyIn addition to the core skills it has to have, your duck also needs a certain energy level to win the races. Otherwise, it can faint on the race track! So, it may not reach the final line. However, there is a solution!Acquire seeds from the Shop section for increasing its energy level.
