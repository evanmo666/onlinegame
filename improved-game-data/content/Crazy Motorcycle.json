  "fullContent": "Homeâ€º BikeCrazy MotorcycleBy OnlineGames.ioMake Game Full ScreenIf Minecraft ever had a wild cousin who ditched mining for motorbikes, Crazy Motorcycle would be it. In this crazy bike game, you'll take a Minecraft-style noob (we call him Nubik), give him a shiny motorcycle, and drop into a floating obstacle course in the sky. There are no roads, no rules, and definitely no safety rails. Just pure blocky platformer. That's the energy this game brings.It's almost like a kid built a racetrack in creative mode, added a few too many stone walls and trees, and then dared you to race through it with a bike. You'll recognize the pixelated grass blocks, chunky trees, mossy stone pillars, ice blocks and floating islands. Even though the theme feels like it's pulled straight out of a Minecraft server, there's no building or mining mode here. Your job is to dodge, jump, and reach the red portal at the end of the level. And there's something extra funny about seeing this square-headed daredevil wipe out in the most dramatic ways. So start playing Crazy Motorcycle now, and then you'll want to play again and again.ControlsPC:Move: W / A / S / D or Arrow KeysJump: SpacebarMobile:Use the on-screen joystick and buttons to steer and jump.How to Play Crazy MotorcycleYour mission is to drive the noob to the red portal block without crashing.Each level is a floating track in the sky.
