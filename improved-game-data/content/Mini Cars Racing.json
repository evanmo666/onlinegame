Yes, it's exactly what it sounds like: soccer, but with cars instead of players. Pick your side, start the engine, and smash the giant ball into the opponent's goal. Play solo or with your buddy, but know that oversized ball physics makes every match unpredictable. And hilarious. Just like in Mini Cars Racing, Car Football features local multiplayer, simple controls, and a fun cartoon style. But this time, it's about scoring goals and bumping your way to victory.Embed URL:https://cloud.onlinegames.io/games/2021/unity/mini-cars-racing/index-og.htmlThis article was updated on May 22, 20252 Player3DArcadeCarCrazyDrivingEmbeddableFreeFunRacingSpeedStuntUnity",
