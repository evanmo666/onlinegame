What do they even mean? Okay, we'll solve that mystery.Checkout Frenzy takes that cashier job and turns it into a super fun online game. Now, you get to be the one behind the register, running your own mini-mart from scratch.  You're stocking chips, checking out customers, or hiring helpers. Everything's in your hands.This online game lets you experience the chaos and challenge of being a cashier and a store manager at the same time. From scanning groceries to calculating change, from setting prices to placing shelves. It’s all about building the busiest store on the block. If you've ever imagined running your own shop, now’s your chance to do it for real (without leaving your browser and spending a penny!)ControlsWASD: Move around the storeDrag left click: Look aroundLeft Click: Pick up boxes, scan items, place goods, rotate furniture, confirm purchasesStarting Your StoreWhen you first enter the game, it’s just you, a register, a computer and an empty space. But that’s about to change fast. Walk up to the computer (in the corner of the store). Use it to order furniture like shelves, fridges, or freezers. Don’t forget to order the products too, things like chips, soda, ice cream, and milk. Boxes will appear outside your store in afew seconds. Go grab them and bring them in.Stock Shelves with GoodsNow it's time to get your goods in place. Dry goods (chips, candy) go on regular shelves. Cold items (milk, eggs) go in the fridge. Frozen foods (ice cream, frozen pizza) belong in the freezer. Fruits and vegetables go in the grocery shelves.Tip: You can rotate shelves to make your store layout smarter. Make space for customers to walk around and create a more natural look!Set PricesEvery product has a base price, but you get to decide what to charge. Hover on the price tag and click set price button on top right. Here you'll see the current price, market price, and profit. Drag the slider to adjust your price. Raise the price to earn more—but don’t go too high over the market price. Customers will walk out if they think it’s too expensive. Try finding that sweet spot: profit + happy customers = store success.Check Out CustomersWhen you're ready, head to the front door. Flip the sign from “Closed” to “Open”. Watch as customers start rolling in with their shopping carts! Here’s where the real checkout frenzy begins.Customers come to your register.
