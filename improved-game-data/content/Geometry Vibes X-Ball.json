  "fullContent": "Home› AvoidGeometry Vibes X-BallBy OnlineGames.ioMake Game Full ScreenGeometry Vibes: X-Ball is a platformer game where you guide a glowing ball on an obstacle course filled with some spiky traps using only one button. You'll try to keep the X-Ball alive as it zips through neon platformer levels filled with sharp corners, instant-death spikes, and giant slopes. All you can do is tap. Tap to go upwards, release to flip direction. But that's more than enough to keep your heart racing. With a slick, futuristic design, this game is a love letter to classic Geometry Dash games, modernized for today's quick-play on browsers. And we've kept the best part: you can race with your friends on the same device. Test your focus, reaction time, and sense of rhythm as a group this time. And give that one friend who always wins an award (or at least bragging rights). So tap and vibe your way through one of the slickest browser games of the year. Play Geometry Vibes: X-Ball now on OnlineGames.io!ControlsHold tap or click: Move upwards.Release tap or click: Move downwards.Game ModesGeometry Vibes: X-Ball offers four game modes, each with its own structure. Let's break down how each one works so you know what to expect when you press play.Classic ModeThis is the core of the game: a single-player, level-based platformer challenge where your goal is to reach the finish line in one piece. There are 10 levels, each designed with precise layouts full of deadly spikes, angled walls, and narrow paths.The X-Ball moves forward on a straight trajectory. Guide it by tapping and releasing taps. The faster you tap, the straighter it goes.You'll have to time your taps carefully to avoid spikes along the top and bottom. Some levels also have square or triangle blocks positioned to trick your timing.The level previews show increasing complexity, tight corridors, sudden slope shifts, and spike traps placed directly above and below.The progression bar at the top shows how close you are to the end.Touch anything that's not the safe platform line, and it's an instant restart.Race Mode (2P–4P Local Multiplayer)Bring your friends in for some chaotic fun! In Race Mode, up to 4 players compete locally on the same keyboard or device. Each player selects their spinner from the customization menu, choosing both skin and trail effects for visual clarity. Controls are split:P1 uses Mouse or space.P2 uses Up arrow keyP3 uses HP4 uses LYou'll race across the same spike-filled levels seen in Classic Mode, but now it's about survival. Fall into a spike or mess up a turn, and you lose the match. There is no respawn. The goal is to reach the end of the level first. There are 10 levels, and each one increases the chaos. This mode turns Geometry Vibes: X-Ball into a party game, perfect for school breaks, family gaming sessions, or group challenges with friends.Endless ModeThis mode is all about survival and distance. There's no ending: your job is to see how far you can go before you crash. Your score is measured in meters, and it's saved as your best record. The speed increases gradually the longer you survive, adding tension as you go. This mode is great for practicing your muscle memory.Challenge ModeThis is where things get intense. You're given 5 unique levels with faster movement, tighter spaces, and shorter paths. Pressure gets even more intense here. Levels are locked behind progress, so you must beat the current one to unlock the next. The obstacles are denser here. Expect wall-to-wall spikes with minimal breathing room and fast direction changes. From normal difficulty to extreme and even \"insane\" levels, this mode will challenge even skilled gamers.Game Features4 exciting modes: Classic, Endless, Challenge, and Local Multiplayer10 levels in Classic and Race modes5 extra-tough levels in Challenge modeOne-button gameplayUnlockable skins and trail effects from the in-game shopLocal multiplayer support for up to 4 playersLanguage support for:EnglishTurkishGermanSpanishArabicPortugueseMore Online Arcade GamesIf you liked this game, try out Geometry Dash, another rhythm platformer game where you jump, dodge, and groove to the beat.
