With just a single tap, you can launch the ball as far as possible, collect coins, and upgrade your golfer’s abilities. The goal is to hit the ball farther with each shot. Just try not to land in a bunker, smack into a tree, take a surprise bath in the water… or, you know, get snatched by an eagle or abducted by a UFO. Weird things may happen in Golf Orbit. ⛳ControlsOn ComputersClick or tap when the arrow is in the green zone for a perfect shot.If the ball stops near the hole, holdthe  left click to aim and release to putt.How to Play Golf OrbitYour goal in Golf Orbit is to launch the ball as far as possible and, if you're lucky (or just really good), sink it into the hole.When you start a round, a swing meter appears, moving back and forth like a metronome.

This means a massive coin boost, allowing you to upgrade your golfer faster and hit even farther in the next round.However, not every shot is perfect. If your ball lands near the hole, you’ll get a second chance. At this point, a more precise aiming mechanic kicks in—you’ll see a guiding arrow showing the ball’s path. Tap to set your shot and release at the right moment to putt the ball into the hole. If you make it on the second attempt, you’ll score a birdie, which triples your earnings.Upgrade The StrokeCoins earned from each round can be spent on three key upgrades:Strength : Boosts your golfer’s power for stronger swings.Speed : Makes the ball travel through the air faster.Bounce : Increases how far the ball rebounds off surfaces.Upgrading these abilities is key to hitting longer shots and setting new records. The farther you hit the ball, the more coins you collect, allowing you to improve your stats even further.The challenge increases as you go, with more difficult landscapes and obstacles appearing.
