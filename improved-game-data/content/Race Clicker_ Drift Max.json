Steer your car with the A and D keys, drift around corners, and try to crash into your opponents to gain the upper hand. Enemies will also aim your car, catch up to you, and knock you down. So show them who's boss on the track.The faster you go, the more likely you'll knock down other racers and score big bonuses. After each race, you can use your earnings to buy upgrades that will help you race even better next round. Keep an eye on your fuel tank, boost your top speed, and raise your income multiplier so you can earn more money from each click.",
    "tips": "Clicking faster at the start means a huge speed boost. Don't be shy about hammering that mouse or space bar. Just, just don't break it, okay? You might need that keyboard later.It's tempting to go straight for speed, but don't forget your fuel tank and income multiplier. You need enough stamina to finish the race and enough profit to keep leveling up.Target racers that are slower or closer to you first. Building confidence by knocking a few off the track can give you the momentum you need for the rest. You can track enemies on the bar at the top of the screen.The races mostly take place on straight tracks, so you'll not need intense formula-like steering anyway. Try gentle taps on the A and D keys to find the sweet spot around each turn. Or you might crash and slow down.",
