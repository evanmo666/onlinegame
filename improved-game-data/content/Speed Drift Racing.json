This forces players to respond to the environment right in time. Additionally, if you brake too hard, the car willl probably spin out, so my advice is to keep calm and apply the brakes in a controlled manner.Reminiscent of Police Chase Drifter, but in a racing setting, offers lots of fun if you're looking for a simple game with intuitive controls.DeveloperFreezeNova created Speed Drift Racing.More Car Games OnlineWe have a great library of car games online.
