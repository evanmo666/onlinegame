You can buy a new vehicle with the sacks of dollars you collect in races.Using ShieldAs you progress through the race in the game, you will encounter shielding power-ups that can help you protect your boat from any crashing. Using power-ups will benefit you greatly throughout the race. Some boats you come across during the race may try to eliminate you by making left and right maneuvers. If you collide, you lose the game, but using the shield protects you and wipes out the other boat. When you take a shield power up, you will see a halo wrapping the boat. Using the shield gives you short-term protection.RulesYou should not crash into other boats or yachts. You should also avoid pontoons. You will even see some buoys moving during the game. You must not contact them either.You will see gaps in some parts of the lanes surrounded by pontoons. They are designed to deceive you.
