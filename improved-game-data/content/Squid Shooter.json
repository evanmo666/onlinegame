    "howToPlay": "You begin in a sandy playground setting, much like the memorable Red Light, Green Light arena from the show, but you’re armed to the teeth this time!\n\nHordes of green-uniformed participants shuffle toward you, and pink-hooded guards step in to lend them support. Don’t forget the giant dolls, reminiscent of the enormous figure from the first episode. Your mission is to stay alive. Dodge side to side and jump over obstacles to avoid lumps of enemies. Shoot your foes before they overwhelm you, and dodge anything they throw your way like cash grenades and coffin crates that explode on impact.\n\nRun and jump around to avoid getting cornered, and switch your weapons with the mouse wheel or number keys for a perfect shot. Your arsenal includes everything from pistols and SMGs to full-blown bazookas! Lobbing a grenade (G) into a group of green suits can clear a path fast. When you spot a giant doll, use a bazooka or grenade launcher for maximum damage. They can soak up a lot of bullets!\n\nThe game escalates in difficulty as you progress, with waves growing more intense, so keep your aim steady and your reflexes sharp.",

If you'd like to play more games by them, you can try Funny Shooter!Editor’s ReviewI tried Squid Shooter after binge-watching the entire Squid Game series, and it felt oddly satisfying to finally fight back against those spooky giant dolls! Charging through an army of teal tracksuits while wielding a bazooka made me laugh out loud. Some might consider this brainrot, but in my opinion, it’s a prety neat combination of funny style, action, and a splash of pop culture references. Perfect for those times you want to let off steam and imagine you’re flipping the script on the show’s challenges.This article was updated on March 21, 20253DActionBattleCrazyFirst Person ShooterFreeGunHorrorShootingUnityWeapon",
