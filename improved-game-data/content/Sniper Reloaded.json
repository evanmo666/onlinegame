These are your guides for adjusting your aim. You'll see these values when you zoom in with the rifle.Horizontal Angle (H): This tells you how far left or right your crosshair is from your target. Adjust the H value to keep up with running enemies, and make sure you're lined up for a perfect shot.Vertical Angle (V): V value shows how much you've moved your aim up or down. It's useful when aiming at enemies on different levels, like those on rooftops. Getting the right vertical angle is key for hitting targets that are far away or getting those headshots.By watching these angles, you can tweak your aim and improve your precision.
