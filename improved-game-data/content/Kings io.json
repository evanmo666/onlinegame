In Kings io, you’re not just playing for fun; you’re playing to dominate the entire map. Your journey begins with a handful of coins, a brave heart, and a dream: to build the strongest army the world has ever seen.Collect Gold CoinsIn this online game, the path to victory is paved with gold and lots of it! Roam the battlefield to collect shiny coins. Then, invest in soldiers who’ll stick by your side while you continue roaming. Footmen and swordsmen make great starters to recruit a troop. However, as you rack up more gold, you can recruit knights, archers, and even mythic beasts to bolster your forces.Build Your KingdomStill, an army alone won’t seal the deal. Buildings are the backbone of any lasting empire. Plunk down houses (preferably near your gold mines) to increase your troop capacity. Construct gold mines and upgrade them to boost your income, and don’t forget the towers to protect your territory. Defense might seem trivial at first, but it's one of the crucial steps as each player in the arena is trying to carve out their share of the gold mines, so you’ll face constant threats. Outsmart them by upgrading your units, placing defensive towers strategically, and swooping in on weak opponents before they can grow stronger. It’s the survival of the smartest in this io game online. If you'd like to become pro at war games, Kings io delivers both fun and an entrance-level difficulty to practice before harder games.  DeveloperKings io was crafted by the creative minds at FreezeNova, a studio known for producing fun online games with endless replay value.
