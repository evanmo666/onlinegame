Well, Nuts and Bolts Puzzle is like the opposite of that! Instead of frantically trying to assemble stuff, you’re gleefully taking everything apart and the best part is: no confusing instructions required. In this fun online game on OnlineGames.io, you’ll see a board jampacked with wooden planks, each secured by bolts. Your mission is to unscrew every single bolt and move them around so all the planks come tumbling down. And there's also a race against the clock with silly and fast puzzle action. If you’ve ever secretly wished you could just toss that unreadable furniture manual out the window, then Nuts and Bolts Puzzle is your chance to feel like a master builder. Take everything apart and have a blast doing it!ControlsPoint-and-click (or tap) to screw or unscrewUnscrew BoltsWhen you open Nuts and Bolts Puzzle, you’ll notice several wooden planks secured with bolts. The goal is simple: remove and relocate these bolts so that every plank eventually falls off the board. You have to be mindful of time, space, and the chain reactions you create.Before making your first move, take a moment to see which bolts are essential for holding the planks. Removing the “wrong” bolt early can cause a plank to drop in a way that blocks a crucial hole. A quick scan of the situation can prevent last-minute scrambles.Each bolt you unscrew must go somewhere else. If you fill up the easy-to-reach holes right away, you might trap yourself later, especially when other planks fall and block certain spots. Try planning out two or three moves ahead. This small effort in thinking can make a huge difference.Remove PlanksThe clock adds an exciting rush to your moves. You can’t spend forever planning. If you realize you’re about to run out of seconds, make a decisive bolt switch to keep progressing. Sometimes it’s better to make a quick move rather than none at all.You might notice special tools at the bottom of your screen, like an extra hole generator or a handy timer freeze. These are your lifelines when things get messy. If a plank gets in the way, or you’re seconds away from a time-out, that’s when you pull out these game-changers.Sometimes, the best strategy is to remove a bolt that supports multiple planks at once. If you time it right, you can knock out several panels in one go. Just be sure you don’t block a bolt behind the fallen wood!Game FeaturesPoint and Click MechanicsTimer ChallengePower-Ups & BoostersHundreds of Levels with Increasing DifficultyFree Online and Mobile Friendly on Web BrowsersGive Nuts and Bolts Puzzle a try today and see if you can conquer the planks before the clock says “time’s up”!
