    "howToPlay": "You begin as a tiny dinosaur in Greenland or Sandland, and your main mission is to eat fruit, grow stronger, and level up. Each fruit fills your DNA bar (at top left)  a little more. Once the bar is full, you level up and evolve into a bigger, stronger version of your dino.But this isn’t a peaceful picnic in Greenland. Bigger dinosaurs will chase you, and if they catch you, it's game over. At the same time, you can hunt smaller dinos to earn XP faster. It’s a constant chase of eat or be eaten.Watch out for the Danger Zone, this foggy danger area appears randomly on the map and will drain your health if you stay in it too long. Stay in bushes to camouflage and hide when things get too intense, especially if a giant dino is right on your tail.After each round, you return to your base where you can merge two of your dinosaurs into one bigger, evolved version. The more dinos you unlock and evolve, the better your odds in the next match.",
