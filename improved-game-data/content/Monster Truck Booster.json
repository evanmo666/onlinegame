I completed all the levels, and I must say some of them were quite challenging. However, I never felt overwhelmed by the difficulty. Designing levels that are difficult yet doable is a tough task, so I truly admire the work put into this game.I think, the unique booster mechanic is what sets it apart from other 2D driving games. It’s not just about racing to the finish line but doing so with style and precision.I must admit that the graphics are simple, but that's part of Monster Truck Booster's charm. In a time when many games prioritize flashy visuals over a really fun gameplay, this one stands out as a hidden gem. So, the minimalistic design does exactly what it needs to: keeping the focus on fun.Lastly, the physics engine feels surprisingly polished for a game of this type. Each level feels fresh, with new challenges to overcome. The coin system and truck upgrades adding a layer of motivation and kept me engaged the whole time.My Rating: 8.5/10 – A fantastic mix of fun and challenge but I would love to see more levels. Perfect for both casual players and die-hard driving game enthusiasts.DeveloperFreezeNova is the creative force behind Monster Truck Booster.More Fun GamesIf you’re hooked on the roaring engines and jaw-dropping stunts of Monster Truck Booster, you’re in for a treat!
